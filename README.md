In this implementation:
1.We load the "Air Passengers" dataset and preprocess it by normalizing the data and splitting it into training and test sets.
2.e design an LSTM architecture with multiple LSTM layers and dropout layers.
3.The model is compiled with mean squared error loss and Adam optimizer.
4.The model is trained on the training set for 100 epochs.
5.We evaluate the model on the test set using root mean squared error (RMSE).
6.Finally, we visualize the model's predictions against the ground truth to assess its accuracy and performance.
